# Explanation for Problem 5
-------------------------------------------------

## A singly linked list was used to implement a blockchain. 
## The time complexity to add each block is O(1) after getting the latest block. 
## To find a specific block the time complexity is O(n).
## The space complexity is O(n) for each block added to the block chain.
